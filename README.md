we built a system KLDHMS (KLD Health Management System) for our school, since the booking system is paper based we made a system that Patients(students) can book a slot depending if they want a psychologist, nurse etc.
we built this using javaswing with XAMPP as database. 
it has a login system, register system and admin can create doctors if anyone applied that is. we built this for a month lol (our first system as a first years)
